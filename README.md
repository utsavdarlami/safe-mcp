# SAFE-MCP: Security Analysis Framework for Evaluation of Model Context Protocol

## About SAFE-MCP

SAFE-MCP is a comprehensive security framework for documenting and mitigating threats in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. This framework adapts the proven MITRE ATT&CK methodology specifically for MCP environments, providing structured documentation of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that target MCP implementations and AI-powered applications.

### Key Features

- **MITRE ATT&CK Alignment**: We use patterns and methodologies from the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, explicitly targeting MCP-specific threats while maintaining compatibility with established security practices.
- **Compliance Mapping**: Each SAFE-MCP technique links to corresponding MITRE ATT&CK techniques where applicable, helping organizations determine compliance with existing security frameworks and controls.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documenting attack techniques across 14 tactical categories, from initial access to impact, with continuous additions as new threats emerge.
- **Actionable Mitigations**: Each technique includes detailed mitigation strategies and detection rules to help defenders protect their MCP deployments.

### How to Use This Framework

1. **Security Teams**: Use the TTP reference table below to understand potential threats to your MCP implementation
2. **Developers**: Review techniques relevant to your MCP tools and implement recommended mitigations
3. **Compliance Officers**: Map SAFE-MCP techniques to your existing security controls via MITRE ATT&CK linkages
4. **Red Teams**: Reference attack techniques for security testing of MCP deployments
